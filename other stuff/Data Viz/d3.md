What is Data Vizualization?

Data visualization is putting data to geometry and color (Yau, Data Points)

Long data vs Wide data
Long data is one or two columns for each row. It is also known as tidy data. Generic model is used in d3.

Wide data is three or more columns for each row. It is also considered untidy data. 

d3 is a frontend JS library that manipulates the DOM and dynamically creates elements that are bound to your data(like styling, tables, charts and text...)
 There is no need to install it, no "bar chart" function, and it isn't simple...
