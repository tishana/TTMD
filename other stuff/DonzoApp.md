My plan for an app to create this week is a workout app called Donzo.

A user will be able to do the following things in this app

1. Create a workout entry. (Add New Workout)
2. Update a workout entry. (Edit Workout)
3. View one workout (View Workout)
4. See all workout entries. (View Workouts)
5. Delete a workout entry. (Delete Workout)
6. Export a list of Workouts. (Export Workouts)

Create Read Update Delete covered.

FrontEnd/ Angular

The frontend or user interface side of Donzo is where the user will be able to enter all of thrier information pertaining to workouts. There will be a form for workout entries that will include:
1. date, 
2. workout type (a dropdown from a list),
3. duration (in minutes),
4. mood after workout (from a dropdown list) *not required

The user will also be able to view all of their workouts on a separate screen (Edit/View Workouts). 

A user will be able to edit a workout entry form (Update) with a button on the View Workouts screen and/or a button on the View Workout screen .

Hope to be able to add if there is time:

- Login and Account Profile for multiple users.


Backend/ .NetCore

Entities:
