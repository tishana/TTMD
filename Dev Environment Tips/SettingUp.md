When prepping your dev environment, its a good idea to have a checklist of actions to keep track of all of the steps.

Here's a sample checklist:

Open files in VSCode (or whatever IDE)
Go to branch or create new branch (git checkout)
Be sure to pull down latest version (git fetch or git pull) "git pull origin development"
Recopy database (and/or reseed your data)

This will help ensure there are no user error mistakes (on your part, at least) to halt you deep within your development. No one wants that...
