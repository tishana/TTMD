“Doing” a Ticket/Completing a Coding Task
Getting Started / Preparing to do the Thing
❏	Open/Create JIRA ticket; understand what the ticket success criteria are
❏	Open correct folders in VS code (& Visual Studio if applicable)
❏	Check out a new branch to work on ticket
❏	Run code in debug mode to further understand ticket success criteria & current state of code
Parts of the Task
❏	Plan out potential solutions to meet success criteria on paper
❏	Code proof of concept if necessary; test manually
❏	Create any new components, classes, etc.
❏	Add tests for new functions necessary and functions being updated (if doing TDD)
❏	Add new functions to code base and update necessary functions
❏	Ensure that tests are both thorough (tests for every function) and passing!
❏	Manually test that success criteria for the ticket are met

❏	Make Pull Request; Re-Assign JIRA ticket 

Updating a Ticket that has been Code Reviewed
Getting Started / Preparing to do the Thing
❏	Open TFS page
❏	Open code in VS Code (& Visual Studio if applicable)
❏	Read through comments on code review
❏	Check out branch on local machine
❏	Run code in debug mode
❏	Identify comment to address first; locate parts of the code that are applicable to comment
Parts of the Task

❏	Determine “starting point” to review code
Parts of the Task
❏	If this is not the “first pass,” look at pending comments & move to resolved if addressed
